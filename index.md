## The Millhouse
We seek to create an environment that cultivates creative talent, entrepreneurship, and community engagement in Greensboro Georgia, and beyond.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Coming Soon

The Millhouse will open it doors soon!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/millhousega/website/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
